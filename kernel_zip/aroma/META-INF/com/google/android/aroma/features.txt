• Added NEON accelerated XOR implementation which improves performance by about 20%.

• Use neon-vfpv4 and softfp.

• Use TCP Congestion algorithm instead of BIC (network speed improvement).

• Optimized cpufreq and interactive governors.

• Used -O3 optimization for inputs and crypto.

• Optimised kernel for performance instead of size.

• GPU frequency overclocked till 1300MHz. (dtb based)

• Overclocked CPU as follows:

 BIG Cores: to 2288 MHz. (dtb based)

 LITTLE Cores: to 1794 MHz. (dtb based)

• Underclocked CPU as follows:

 BIG Cores: to 208MHz. (dtb based)

 LITTLE Cores: to 208MHz. (dtb based)

• Mark some IRQS and Kthreads as performance critical.

• Patched some SafetyNet flags to bypass detection of root.

• Enable zram support and set default compressor as lz4.

• Reduced transition latency for cpu frequencies.

• Switch to a lower charging voltage more quickly. This results in a slight reduce in battery capacity (about 3% less usable capacity) but this helps to extend the cycle life of the battery.

• Fixed CPU throttling of both clusters. Little cores will get throttled only if temperature reaches 95°C.

• Adjusted default gpu highspeed clock to 1001MHz for a smoother ui experience.

• Upstream LZ4 compressor module and other related optimisations.

• Implemented Dynamic FSync 2.0 (Disables Fsync when screen is on so as to improve performance)

• Reduced touchscreen touch latency (To solve a bug on I2C).

• Fixed drivedroid support.

• Add ntfs3 driver by paragon software and switch to it. (Still requires app like ntfs mounter by paragon to read ntfs filesystems because android os doesnt have necessary libraries to mount ntfs on its own).

• Added a bunch of famous governors (bioshock, blu_active, smartmax, intelliactive, lionheart, and more) and enabled all stock governors including schedutil.

• Tweak gpu dvfs files' permissions for better performance as suggested.

• Undervolted the whole soc (exynos7885) including CPU and GPU.

• Automatic scaling to overclocked frequencies. No need to force frequencies!

• CPU throttling bypass increased till 2184MHz for big cores.

• Automatic detection of root when flashing kernel. If you are already rooted, you won't lose root when flashing kernel as from now. So, no need to flash magisk after kernel!!

• Added powersuspend driver v1.8 - saves battery when screen is off.

• Removed/disabled some useless debugging  and logging codes.

• Disable GFS for better ui responsiveness.

• Slight improvement in boot's speed.

• Optional spectrum support - Flash enable_spectrum_support.zip on your internal storage to enable spectrum.

• Based on latest A305F oneui 3 kernel source.

• Compiled kernel with Vortex Clang 14 toolchain.

• Enabled Clang LTO for better performance.

• Unified kernel sources for A10, A20, A20e, A30, A30s and A40.

• Fixed double tap to wake (DT2W) for some devices using custom ROMs.

• Increased A10 input charging current upto 1.2A

• Updated TFA98xx audio codec driver from 4.2.0 to 6.7.8 - Used by A20, A20e, A30, A30s and A40.

• Some tweaks to reduce jitter and UI lags

• Added fingerprint boost driver

• Battery tweaks to reduce idle battery drain

• Added support for exFAT filesystem 

• Fixed all warnings in kernel source.

• Improvements to MTP driver for compatibility with OneUI and AOSP/GSI.

• DTB is used to customize Eureka features such as CPU and GPU frequencies.

• Added a custom flashlight control driver which will be used on AOSP/LOS based ROMs. It will also fix low flashlight issue on GSIs. Footej camera app is recommended for custom roms.

• Implemented WireGuard vpn driver.

• Upstream Linux Kernel Version from 4.4.177 to 4.4.302 (Eureka 9.0)

• Added ondemandplus CPU governor.

• Added CFQ, BFQ, Deadline, Maple and ZEN-v2 I/O schedulers.

• Tune CFQ I/O scheduler based on Pixel 4.

• Added a custom backlight brightness controller. When enabled in EKM app, the brightness can go lower than stock. [Feature can be used with EKM app only].

• Fixed GPU frequency being limited to 1100 MHz after being throttled.

• Some optimisations for better FS performance for EXT4 filesystem.

• Fixed non-detection of some gamepad controllers (such as chinese ones).

• Patched kernel for android 12 (S) - Backported BPF support.

• Two kernel versions with different schedulers are available: EMS (Exynos Mobile Scheduler) which is a scheduler based on EAS (Energy Aware Scheduling), and HMP (Heterogeneous Multi-Processing) scheduler.

• EMS kernel custom CPU governors: Blu-Schedutil, ElectroUtilX & PwrUtilX.

• AROMA Installer is used to facilitate the installation of Eureka Kernel.

• OneUI and AOSP kernels & custom DTBs are merged into 1 zip (kept size as small as possible).

• Permissive selinux: SElinux can be switched to enforcing after boot.

• EurekaSound (ESOUND) v1.0, a basic headphone audio controller (For AOSP only).

• Eureka Display Control (EKCAL) which is based on Samsung mDNIE driver (Not available for A20e).

• WIFI sharing is fixed if this kernel is used with an Eureka ROM built as from 15 Feb 2022.

• Added required support for FM Radio for Eureka ROMs.

• Switched to fq_codel queue discipline. Better download/upload speed.
